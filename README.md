# BEN_LF-rTMS

We used publicly available data and found that low-frequency rTMSï¼ˆLF-rTMS) over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) reduces brain entropy (BEN) in the medial orbito-frontal cortex and subgenial anterior cingulate cortex (MOFC/sgACC). This finding replicates our previous 2017 result showing that high-frequency rTMS (HF-rTMS) increases brain entropy in the MOFC/sgACC (Song, Chang et al. 2019).

We also found that LF-rTMS over the left DLPFC increases BEN in the putamen, while our recent study demonstrated that subthreshold iTBS reduces BEN in the same region (Liu, Song et al. 2025) and notably, a 10-day course of HF-rTMS targeting the left DLPFC in chronic smokers was found to induce significant reductions in striatal BEN (Chang, Zhang et al. 2018).


This discovery is forthcoming in Cerebral Cortex.

The publicly available data was obtained from OpenNeuro ds001927 (https://openneuro.org/datasets/ds001927/versions/2.1.0).

BEN maps and statistical results can be accessed at OSF (https://osf.io/wj89x/).
