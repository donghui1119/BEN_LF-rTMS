# BEN_LF-rTMS


## Publication


The research is published in Cerebral Cortex (Song et al. 2025,https://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhaf171)!


## Finds

1. We used publicly available data and found that low-frequency rTMSï¼ˆLF-rTMS) over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) reduces brain entropy (BEN) in the medial orbito-frontal cortex and subgenial anterior cingulate cortex (MOFC/sgACC). This finding replicates our previous 2017 result showing that high-frequency rTMS (HF-rTMS) increases brain entropy in the MOFC/sgACC (Song, Chang et al. 2019).

2. Intriguingly, HF-rTMS over left DLPFC is a proven therapy for major depressive disorder (MDD). Our earlier work (Liu, Song et al. 2020) showed that elevated BEN correlates with greater depression severity in MDD patients.

3. We also found that LF-rTMS over the left DLPFC increases BEN in the putamen, while our recent study demonstrated that subthreshold iTBS reduces BEN in the same region (Liu, Song et al. 2025) and notably, a 10-day course of HF-rTMS targeting the left DLPFC in chronic smokers was found to induce significant reductions in striatal BEN (Chang, Zhang et al. 2018).


4. What's More, we found that different BEN changes occurred when stimulating the temporoparietal junction and visual cortex. LF-rTMS at the L-TPJ increased BEN in the right TPJ, while LF-rTMS at the L-OCC decreased BEN in the posterior cingulate cortex.
